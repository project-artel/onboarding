# Project Context

Fill this document during project initialization. Agents must verify commands against repository configuration before running them.

## Overview

- Product: onboarding
- Primary users: TODO
- Core domain: TODO
- Runtime environment: TODO

## Architecture

- Entry points: TODO
- Main modules: TODO
- Dependency direction: TODO
- External systems: GitHub repository `project-artel/onboarding`; Jira project `ARTEL` via the `mcp-atlassian` MCP server; Notion workspace via the `ntn` CLI
- Persistent data: TODO

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | TODO |
| Run locally | TODO |
| Format | TODO |
| Lint | TODO |
| Type-check | TODO |
| Unit tests | TODO |
| Integration tests | TODO |
| Build | TODO |
| Set up Jira credentials | `cp .jira.env.example .jira.env` |
| Install Notion CLI | `curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev \| bash` |
| Verify Notion CLI auth | `ntn whoami` |

### Jira
Jira access goes through the `mcp-atlassian` MCP server, declared in `.mcp.json`
at the repository root. Claude Code starts it on demand and asks for approval
the first time it connects.

Credentials live in `.jira.env`, which the server reads through `--env-file`.
Copy `.jira.env.example` and fill in `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, and
`JIRA_API_TOKEN`, issuing the token at
`https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens`. `.gitignore`
excludes `.jira.env`; never commit it.

The server reads that file itself, so the setup does not depend on how Claude
Code was launched or on which shell exports the variables. Do not register a
`jira` server in user scope as well, or two copies start.

### Notion
Notion access goes through the `ntn` CLI. Agents follow
`.agents/skills/notion-cli/SKILL.md`, which is symlinked into
`.claude/skills/notion-cli` for Claude Code.

Authenticate with a token rather than `ntn login`: export `NOTION_API_TOKEN`
from your shell profile, using a token issued at
`https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations`. The integration must be connected
to each page and data source it needs, otherwise reads return 404. Never commit
the token.

Write operations (`ntn pages create`, `ntn files create`, `ntn workers deploy`)
are not pre-approved and require explicit confirmation.
