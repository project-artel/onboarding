# Issue Workflow

## Why

An issue defines the problem and acceptance boundary. It should not prescribe implementation before investigation.

## Ready Criteria

An issue is ready when it has:
- clear problem statement
- user or system impact
- acceptance criteria
- known constraints
- explicit non-goals when scope could expand
- dependencies or blockers
- an assignee, an existing Epic (상위 항목), and the 작업 유형 and 레포지토리 fields set
- an explicit assignee accountId for the person responsible; do not leave ownership to a branch or PR author
- an Epic selected from the repository and work domain before branch creation; do not leave an 일반 작업 without a parent

## Issue Template

## Validation Notes
```

## Lifecycle

1. Create or refine issue.
2. Confirm dependencies and priority.
3. Mark in progress only when active work starts.
4. Link branch, plan, and PR. The branch name carries the issue key, which is
   what ties commits and the PR back to this issue.
5. Update scope changes in issue before implementing them.
6. Close only after acceptance criteria and required validation pass.

## Sizing

Split issue when it contains multiple independently releasable outcomes or requires unrelated ownership areas.

Do not split tightly coupled steps that cannot provide value or validation independently.
