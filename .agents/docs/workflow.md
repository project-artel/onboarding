# Development Workflow

## Why

Small, explicit steps reduce regressions and make review, rollback, and handoff predictable.

## Work Classification

Trivial work:
- documentation typo
- isolated formatting fix
- deterministic one-line configuration change

Non-trivial work:
- behavior change
- bug fix requiring investigation
- dependency or schema change
- cross-module refactor
- user-facing workflow change

Non-trivial work requires a concise plan. Use the `writing-plan` skill when it
is installed.

## End-to-End Flow

1. Confirm goal, scope, acceptance criteria, and non-goals.
2. Read project context, relevant code, tests, and recent changes.
3. Link or create an issue. Non-trivial development branches require one.
4. Create a branch using the naming rule in `## Jira-Driven Development Flow`.
5. Write a concise implementation plan; use `writing-plan` when installed.
6. Identify architecture impact, tradeoffs, risks, and rollback.
7. Implement the smallest coherent change.
8. Follow `testing.md`; use an installed testing skill when available.
9. Review the complete diff for scope, correctness, and accidental churn.
10. Commit coherent units using the commit convention.
11. Open a draft PR with evidence and explicit remaining risk. Follow
    `pull-request.md` for draft ownership and user-notification rules.
12. Address review without hiding unresolved concerns.

## Jira-Driven Development Flow

Use this pipeline when the work item is tracked in Jira and the user asks for
end-to-end development. Jira access is described in `project.md`.

1. **Create the issue.** `jira_create_issue` in project `ARTEL`, issue type
   `작업` unless the work is an epic, a defect, or a deliverable that spans more
   than one repository. Follow `issue.md` for the body. Set the identifying
   fields explicitly; a summary alone leaves the issue unassigned and
   unclassified, and it will not show up in the right filters:
   - `assignee`: the person who will do the work. Set their Jira `accountId`; never leave it empty or infer ownership from the branch/PR author.
   - `parent`: select the existing Epic that owns this repository and outcome. Every 일반 작업 must have this parent before branch creation.
   - `customfield_10080` (작업 유형): `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
     `refactor`, or `infra`. Required; the call fails without it.
   - `customfield_10081` (레포지토리): `orchestration-server`, `agent-server`,
     `home`, `sdk`, or `없음`. Required; the call fails without it.
   - `labels`: add one only when the work belongs to a theme the two fields
     above do not already express. Reuse an existing label instead of
     inventing a near-duplicate.
   - `customfield_10015` (시작 날짜) and `duedate` (기한): leave them empty at
     creation and stamp them from the commit and PR dates as the work moves —
     see `## Issue Dates`.

   When the deliverable changes more than one repository, it is not a `작업` at
   all. It becomes a `스토리` with one `Subtask` per repository under it — read
   `## Multi-Repository Work` below before setting the fields above.

2. **Move to 진행 중 and create the branch.** Transition the issue, then create
   the branch in the same step so status and branch never drift. Derive the
   name from the issue:

   ```text
   <작업 유형>/<issue summary with spaces replaced by hyphens>-<ISSUE KEY>
   ```

   For example, `chore/orchestration-jira-mcp-셋팅-ARTEL-69`. Keep Korean
   characters as they appear in the summary. Branch from `origin/develop`.

   The issue key in the branch name is what ties branch, commits, and PR back
   to the issue, so never create the branch before the issue exists. Keep one
   issue per branch, never force-push a shared branch without coordination,
   and delete the branch after merge unless follow-up work depends on it.

3. **Plan.** Use the `writing-plan` skill. Plans land in `.plan/general/`.

4. **Review the plan.** Use the `plan-review` skill.

5. **Loop on the plan.** Fold each finding back into the plan and review again.
   Leave the loop only when no remaining finding requires a plan change. Do not
   start implementing to settle a planning disagreement.

6. **Implement.** Follow the implementation, testing, diff-review, and commit
   steps of `## End-to-End Flow`.

7. **Pair review.** Use the `pair-review` skill, which drives the
   `pair-review-critic` subagent against the implementation. Resolve or
   explicitly accept every finding before opening the PR.

8. **Open the draft PR.** Follow `pull-request.md`, targeting `develop`. Fill in
   `Code Walkthrough` with one entry per changed unit, and end the body with a
   `Jira: <ISSUE KEY>` trailer so the issue links back.

When this issue is blocked by another issue in this repository that has not
merged yet, base its PR on that issue's branch rather than the default branch and
stack the two — see `## Stacked Pull Requests` in `pull-request.md`.

Move the issue to 검토 중 when the PR opens, and to 완료 only after merge and
required validation pass.

## Issue Dates

Every issue carries 시작 날짜 (`customfield_10015`) and 기한 (`duedate`). Both
record what actually happened in Git rather than an estimate, so the two fields
read as the work's real span:

- **시작 날짜** — the date of the first commit carrying the issue key, or the PR
  open date when that is earlier. Stamp it when the issue moves to 진행 중; if
  the branch has no commit yet, use the date the branch was created.
- **기한** — the date the PR merged. Stamp it when the issue moves to 완료. When
  several PRs carry the key, use the last merge.

Write both as `YYYY-MM-DD` in `Asia/Seoul`, so a late-night commit lands on the
day it was made locally. A `스토리` takes the earliest 시작 날짜 and the latest
기한 among the `Subtask` issues under it. Do not overwrite a date that is already
set unless the Git history contradicts it.

## Multi-Repository Work

One deliverable that changes more than one repository is filed as a `스토리` with
one `Subtask` per repository under it. `issue.md` defines the structure and the
link types; this section covers the pipeline.

1. **Create the `스토리`.** Issue type `스토리`, parented to the Epic that owns the
   outcome. Record the acceptance criteria for the whole deliverable and the
   merge order — the repository that defines an API, schema, or SDK surface
   merges before the ones that consume it. The `스토리` carries neither 작업 유형 nor
   레포지토리, because the type has no such field and both are per-repository
   facts that belong on each `Subtask`. It gets no branch and no PR.

2. **Create one `Subtask` per repository.** Issue type `Subtask` with the `스토리` as
   `parent`, that repository's 레포지토리 option, its own 작업 유형, and its own
   assignee accountId — the same fields step 1 of
   `## Jira-Driven Development Flow` sets. The parent is what records membership,
   so never also link a `Subtask` to its `스토리` with `relates to`. Add a `blocks`
   link wherever merge order is real, and get its direction right —
   `## Blocks Links` in `issue.md` carries the call and the read-back check.

3. **Run steps 2–8 of `## Jira-Driven Development Flow` once per repository
   `Subtask`**, in that repository's checkout or worktree, in merge order. A
   `Subtask` is developed exactly like a standalone `작업` — its own branch from the
   automation, plan, plan review, implementation, testing, pair review, and PR,
   with the same 진행 중 / 검토 중 / 완료 transitions. Nothing is skipped because
   the slice is small.

   A `blocks` chain that crosses repositories cannot be stacked, because a stack
   lives in one repository: merge the blocking repository's PR, then rebase and
   open the next. Two `Subtask` issues that land in the same repository are
   stacked like any other chain.

4. **Keep the trail on the `Subtask`.** The branch name, commit trailers, and the
   PR `Jira:` trailer all carry the `Subtask` key, never the `스토리` key.

5. **Report up as you go.** Whenever a `Subtask` changes state, comment the
   rolled-up status on the `스토리`: which repositories are merged, which are
   waiting, and any change to the merge order or the shared contract. Move the
   `스토리` to 완료 last, after every `Subtask` is merged and validated.

`Subtask` needs four fields the type does not carry by default: 작업 유형
(`customfield_10080`), 레포지토리 (`customfield_10081`), 시작 날짜
(`customfield_10015`), and 기한 (`duedate`). Without 작업 유형 the branch
automation has no prefix to derive a branch name from, and without 레포지토리 the
`Subtask` drops out of every repository filter. When a create call rejects one of
them, stop and ask a Jira admin to put it on the `Subtask` type; do not file the
work as a `작업` to work around it.

## Change Rules

- Preserve existing architecture unless the task requires changing it.
- Keep unrelated cleanup out of the change.
- Add abstractions only when they remove demonstrated complexity or match an established pattern.
- Keep migrations backward-compatible when practical.
- Prefer reversible rollout for high-risk behavior.

## Stop Conditions

Pause and surface the problem when:
- requirements conflict
- destructive action lacks approval
- required credentials or external access are unavailable
- validation reveals an unrelated pre-existing failure that blocks confidence
- scope expands beyond the agreed issue or plan

Do not silently guess through high-impact ambiguity.
